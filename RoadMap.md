# RoadMap

Considering the existing Android app with basic functionality in the separate repository (https://github.com/wipedlifepotato/Symbio-Android), here's the proposed RoadMap for Symbio:

## Phase 1: Core Completion (Q1 2025)
- **Complete Telegram Bot**: Implement full functionality for task creation, wallet operations, notifications via Telegram API.
- **Android App Enhancement**: Expand basic Android app (Symbio-Android repo) to include full task management, wallet integration, chat, and dispute handling. Sync with main API.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Refine web and mobile interfaces based on React prototypes. Implement responsive design across all platforms.
- **Testing & QA**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing, security audit, performance optimization.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Q2 2025)
- **Notifications System**: Push notifications for task updates, payments, disputes across web, Android, Telegram.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Admin analytics for user activity, revenue, dispute resolution metrics.
- **Multi-language Support**: Expand i18n beyond Ukrainian/Russian to major languages.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Additional cryptocurrencies or fiat payment options.

## Phase 3: Scaling & Production (Q3 2025)
- **Production Deployment**: Docker-based deployment, monitoring, backup systems.
- **Mobile App Store Release**: Publish Android app on Google Play with full feature set.
- **API Rate Limiting & Optimization**: Advanced rate limiting, API versioning.
- **Community Features**: User forums, reputation system enhancements.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (Q4 2025)
- **Plugin System**: Expand Lua/WASM for third-party integrations.
- **Enterprise Features**: Bulk operations, team management, advanced escrow options.
- **Mobile Apps**: iOS app development mirroring Android functionality.
- **Global Expansion**: Localization, compliance with international regulations.

## Android-Specific Roadmap
Since Android app exists with basic functionality in separate repo (https://github.com/wipedlifepotato/Symbio-Android):
- **Immediate**: Integrate full API (tasks, wallets, disputes) into Android app.
- **Short-term**: Add offline capabilities, biometric auth, push notifications.
- **Long-term**: Advanced features like QR code payments, NFC integration, voice commands.

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
- **Code Refactoring**: Modularize Go backend, improve error handling.
- **Documentation**: Expand API docs, user guides, developer resources.
- **Security**: Regular audits, dependency updates, vulnerability patching.

This roadmap positions Symbio as a comprehensive, multi-platform freelance platform with strong Android integration.
